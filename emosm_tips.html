				<h2>Eat a Balanced Diet</h2>
				<p>A balanced diet includes a variety of fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, whole grains, and healthy fats.

Eating balanced meals helps maintain body weight, reduces the risk of chronic diseases, and fosters overall health.</p>

				<h2>Regular Exercise</h2>
				<p>Regular physical activity helps control weight, reduce the risk of heart disease, strengthen bones and muscles, and improve mental health and mood. Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate aerobic activity or 75 minutes of vigorous activity each week, along with muscle-strengthening exercises on 2 or more days a week.</p>

				<h2>Adequate Sleep</h2>
				<p>Good sleep is essential for good health. Poor sleep can increase the risk of heart disease, diabetes, and depression. Adults should aim for 7-9 hours per night.

				<h2>Hydration</h2>
				<p>Staying hydrated is crucial for maintaining health and energy levels. Water regulates body temperature, keeps joints lubricated, prevents infections, delivers nutrients to cells, and keeps organs functioning properly. A common recommendation is to drink eight 8-ounce glasses of water a day, but needs can vary based on factors like climate and activity level.</p>

				<h2>Regular Check-ups</h2>
