                    Hello! My name's Evan Mosmiller and I created this website. I created this site as a school project for my Software Development class during my Senior year of college. Why did I choose to make a website focusing on fast food? Well, food is something we all put a great emphasis on, and is a necessary part of life, you need to eat. Finding and eating a meal meant life and death survival for our ancestors. However, today we don't go out and hunt for a meal, we now work to gain money to buy one. But there's so many options. Today, there's 100's of fast food chains nationwide giving the average person more than enough options where as they can be "picky" with what they want to eat. Knowing what is in your food and its nutritional information is important however for people who want to maintain a healthy lifestyle. I think websites like mine are important, as I too in actuality eat a lot of fast food and have over my lifetime and I feel like many other people have too. It's just too convienent, but not necessarily healthy. I would say I'm knowledgeable and experienced in the current North American lifestyle of "eating-out", and know of if not tried most menu items of a large variety of fast-food chains. At the time of making this website I've worked in the food and dining industry for 5+ years. So I feel making a website about food by combining my experience in various restaraunts and my studies at school, is somewhat surreal but honestly perfect at the same time. I want to say thank you for visiting my site! Also try to eat healthy, I know it's hard but this is what this site was made for, to help. Cheers!
